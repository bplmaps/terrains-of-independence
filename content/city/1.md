Boston's distinctive geography transformed it from a key British port to a center of political unrest, where residents navigated a growing conflict between liberty and freedom. 

Soldiers, civilians, free and enslaved workers, migrants, and many others jostled together in an urban area of just a few square miles. The city’s shape—a peninsula connected to the mainland by a tombolo, or narrow spit of land—created a terrain for both resistance and military strategy that pivoted on key points and routes. This landscape shaped the early events of Revolutionary crisis, from the Boston Massacre in 1770 to the Tea Party in 1773 to the early months of fighting in 1775.
