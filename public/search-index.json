Though New Englanders cultivated a unique system of local governance and religious organization that eschewed hierarchy and operated largely outside of imperial control, colonists still shared a common language, legal traditions, and cultural practices with the people of Great Britain. Most felt closer ties to cities in Europe—like Liverpool and Glasgow—than they did to those in nearby colonies.</p>\n<p>The Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) brought profound changes to British North America and to colonists’ connections to the empire. Britain acquired vast new territories, including all of the French territory east of the Mississippi River and in Canada, as well as Spanish Florida. From the Great Lakes to the Caribbean, Britain gained access to fur markets and sugar-growing regions. Boston, too, benefitted from these global gains, profiting off an enslaved workforce and its ties to Caribbean plantations.</p>\n<p>Yet the financial strains of staging a global war pushed many Bostonians to question their place in the British Empire, as new tax policies and a more persistent military presence infringed on the relative autonomy that they had come to enjoy and expect.</p>\n","length":207,"title":"Empire","type":"table-of-contents","url":"https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/empire/"},{"content":"<p>Emanuel Bowen and Robert Sayer’s map of the Americas at the end of the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) shows New England in the context of the much wider Western Hemisphere.

The map labels the “Abnakies” (Abenaki) in Maine and the “Micmacs” (Mi’kmaq) in Nova Scotia. It also provides special detail in an inset showing the stronghold town of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, which occupied a strategic location at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. New Englanders led a siege of Louisbourg in 1745, a prelude to the conflict that erupted into the Seven Year’s War in 1756.

But in the eighteenth century, Boston was at the center of a distinct regional economy formed by Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, and the city was often referred to as “the Metropolis of New England.” This French map, created by Georges-Louis Le Rouge, juxtaposes two scales: a sweeping view of New England’s contested territories alongside an intimate glimpse of Boston.</p>\n<p>Though the map claims to portray the “most inhabited part” of the region, this designation referred only to areas inhabited by colonists, not to the ancestral homelands of the thousands of Indigenous peoples displaced by European colonizers. A large interior frontier, marked by spaces not yet divided into towns, ran through Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and the disputed territory of what is now Vermont.</p>\n<p>The environmental conditions of upland New England were poorly suited for the large-scale plantation agricultural practices of the eighteenth century, which meant colonists were dependent on coastal trade for economic growth. As the British government began to consolidate control over its international trade networks, New England, and Boston in particular, stood in a particularly vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>Le Rouge brought a unique perspective to the map you see here. Born in Germany, he later trained as a military engineer before relocating to Paris, where he built a career translating and adapting English maps for French audiences. This map reflects his careful attention to both regional and local detail. In the inset at the upper left, Boston is presented as a complex urban space, rather than a dot on a regional map. Placed together, these local and regional scales help us understand how Boston’s local geography shaped imperial ambitions across a contested New England. Compare the Boston inset to the regional map of New England.

Most rural New Englanders felt disconnected from the grievances voiced by merchants in the city.</p>\n<p>The separateness of these spheres shifted when British administrators began undermining Boston’s autonomy and local governance. While farmers in places like Concord may have been ambivalent about the taxation of trade goods, they <em>did</em> bristle at threats to self-government that they had known for over a century. The resulting alliance of urban Bostonians and rural New Englanders proved crucial—it united the material and political resources needed to convert scattered discontent into an outright rebellion against imperial control.</p>\n<div class=\"guidepost\">\n<p>What qualifies as Boston?

During this three-month period, word of military clashes between rebels and British troops spread.

Despite eight years of service, Hall’s life was marred by the Revolution’s unfulfilled promise of liberty.

Eight served in Captain John Durkee’s integrated company. Their reasons for enlisting were complex. Some shared white colonists’ frustrations with British taxation; others saw military service as a way to maintain local alliances with their white neighbors.

The “Book of Negroes,” from the 1783 British evacuation of New York, records 18 people from Massachusetts, including the Slade family—Freelove, her husband Lot, and their son Roger—who escaped in 1779.

Black women often led this charge. In 1773, a group of enslaved residents petitioned the Massachusetts General Court, questioning how colonists could demand liberty while denying it to others. Elizabeth Freeman (c. 1744–1829), born “Mum Bett,” used the new state constitution, which declared “all men are born free and equal,” to successfully challenge slavery in court in 1781.

Upholding their commitment to non-violence, Quakers joined ordinary men and women outside the political elite in turning to boycotts and non-importation to express discontent with British rule. As leaders of the Homespun movement, Quakers encouraged colonists to make their own clothing instead of buying British goods. The movement included many women who organized community spinning bees and managed their families’ purchases of textiles and clothing.</p>\n<figure id=\"tea-destroyed\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#tea-destroyed\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"TKTK\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/landmarks/tea-destroyed.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">1773 · <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rbpe.0370240a\" target=\"_blank\">Library of Congress</a></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"TKTK\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/landmarks/tea-destroyed.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">1773 · <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rbpe.0370240a\" target=\"_blank\">Library of Congress</a></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Revolutionary landmarks were referenced in all forms of popular culture, including widely published broadsides.

The title’s reference to “TEA, DESTROYED BY INDIANS&quot; both acknowledges the colonists’ disguise and celebrates their act of rebellion.

Hall was a freed Black man whose life intersected with key Revolutionary sites across Boston Harbor. At Castle William, a strategic British fortification shown in the plan <a href=\"../castle-william/\">on the next page</a>, Hall and fourteen other free Black men made history in 1775 when they were initiated into Freemasonry through a British military lodge. While the British would later burn Castle William during their retreat from Boston in March 1776, Hall’s legacy endured through his activism and leadership. Today, his gravesite has become a landmark and destination for Freemasons and civil rights advocates from around the world.

Tea drinking’s popularity led to a surge in production of teapots, cups, saucers, and spoons. This spoon, excavated from Faneuil Hall, may have stirred tea sweetened with sugar produced by enslaved labor in the Caribbean, reflecting Boston’s ties to a wider empire built on slavery. During the Revolution, tea took on a new meaning as a symbol of resistance, as colonists threw chests of tea overboard in protest, and women boycotted tea in favor of drinking chocolate.</p>\n<h2>Region</h2>\n<p><strong>Flint Ballast, early 17th century, excavated by the Institute for Conservation Archaeology at the Maudlin Archaeological District in Charlestown, 1982-1983, City of Boston Archaeology Program</strong></p>\n<p>Many ships made voyages along the coast of the New England region in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ballast consisted of heavy materials such as rocks placed in a ship’s hold to maintain stability and proper buoyancy during sailing. This ballast came from the James Garrett House Site in Charlestown, which was excavated before Boston’s Big Dig construction project. Garrett, a wealthy English merchant, lived there between 1639 and 1656.
