                  The American Revolution is a profoundly place-based story. In
                  1775, war ignited in Boston and its surrounding towns, fueled
                  by conflicts over trade, governance, and imperial authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>But why here?</strong> What was it about Boston and
                  Massachusetts that made the region such a tinderbox for
                  revolutionary activity in the late eighteenth century?

                  Maps tie together Revolutionary history and geography. They
                  illuminate connections between the local and the global. They
                  draw us into stories about the diverse ways people understood
                  their own lives and the world around them.

                  The American Revolution’s early episodes in Massachusetts took
                  place in a very different landscape than the one we live in
                  today. Boston’s distinctive geography shaped the discontent
                  which flared up into radicalism and revolt. It created
                  opportunities for actions and events that neither the
                  colonists nor the British authorities could fully anticipate.
                  After all, the people who took part in the Revolution, and
                  whose lives were willingly or unwillingly shaped by the war,
                  did not yet know that the United States of America lay in the
                  future.

                  This exhibition unfolds across a series of
                  <strong>scales</strong>. These scales offer ways of thinking
                  about size and location that help us understand how places
                  connect, from the expansiveness of empire to the small details
                  of buildings and landmarks. Each of these scales draws
                  attention to different sets of spatial patterns and historical
                  forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the nation marks the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the
                  American Revolution, we invite you to explore how the places
                  of Boston and Massachusetts shaped this era—not merely as the
                  backdrops, but as the
                  <strong>terrains of independence</strong>.
