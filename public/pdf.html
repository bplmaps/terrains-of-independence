                  The American Revolution is a profoundly place-based story. In
                  1775, war ignited in Boston and its surrounding towns, fueled
                  by conflicts over trade, governance, and imperial authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>But why here?</strong> What was it about Boston and
                  Massachusetts that made the region such a tinderbox for
                  revolutionary activity in the late eighteenth century?

                  Maps tie together Revolutionary history and geography. They
                  illuminate connections between the local and the global. They
                  draw us into stories about the diverse ways people understood
                  their own lives and the world around them.

                  The American Revolution’s early episodes in Massachusetts took
                  place in a very different landscape than the one we live in
                  today. Boston’s distinctive geography shaped the discontent
                  which flared up into radicalism and revolt. It created
                  opportunities for actions and events that neither the
                  colonists nor the British authorities could fully anticipate.
                  After all, the people who took part in the Revolution, and
                  whose lives were willingly or unwillingly shaped by the war,
                  did not yet know that the United States of America lay in the
                  future.

                  This exhibition unfolds across a series of
                  <strong>scales</strong>: <a href="#page-empire">Empire</a>,
                  <a href="#page-region">Region</a>, <a href="#page-city">City</a>,
                  <a href="#page-landmark">Landmark</a>, and
                  <a href="#page-nation">Nation</a>. These scales offer ways of
                  thinking about size and location that help us understand how
                  places connect, from the expansiveness of empire to the small
                  details of buildings and landmarks. Each of these scales draws
                  attention to different sets of spatial patterns and historical
                  forces.
                </p>

                  As the nation marks the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the
                  American Revolution, we invite you to explore how the places
                  of Boston and Massachusetts shaped this era—not merely as the
                  backdrops, but as the

                  <strong>In the eighteenth century, the British Empire stretched
                    across oceans and continents, with Boston perched at the
                    western edge of the Atlantic world.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Colonial Bostonians identified firmly as <em>British</em>,
                  rather than American. Though New Englanders cultivated a
                  unique system of local governance and religious organization
                  that eschewed hierarchy and operated largely outside of
                  imperial control, colonists still shared a common language,
                  legal traditions, and cultural practices with the people of
                  Great Britain. Most felt closer ties to cities in Europe—like
                  Liverpool and Glasgow—than they did to those in nearby
                  colonies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) brought profound changes to
                  British North America and to colonists’ connections to the
                  empire. Britain acquired vast new territories, including all
                  of the French territory east of the Mississippi River and in
                  Canada, as well as Spanish Florida. From the Great Lakes to
                  the Caribbean, Britain gained access to fur markets and
                  sugar-growing regions. Boston, too, benefitted from these
                  global gains, profiting off an enslaved workforce and its ties
                  to Caribbean plantations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet the financial strains of staging a global war pushed many
                  Bostonians to question their place in the British Empire, as
                  new tax policies and a more persistent military presence
                  infringed on the relative autonomy that they had come to enjoy
                  and expect.

                      Emanuel Bowen and Robert Sayer’s map of the Americas at
                      the end of the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) shows New
                      England in the context of the much wider Western
                      Hemisphere. Colorful boundary lines, accompanied by blocks
                      of legal text, describe how European empires divided their
                      claims over the continent at the war’s end. As Britain’s
                      reach expanded over the Americas, Boston’s wharves became
                      a microcosm of imperial geography, with enslaved people,
                      Indigenous exiles, Caribbean plantation goods, local
                      investors, and European financiers knitted together in an
                      interdependent system.

                      The treaty ending the war did not spell victory for
                      everyone, particularly the Indigenous peoples who faced
                      displacement and shrinking territorial sovereignty. Even
                      though this map names many Indigenous nations, the
                      cartouche, or decorative title block, exemplifies how
                      European mapmakers depicted Indigenous people in
                      stereotyped and objectified ways. The two figures’
                      exoticized poses make them seem like passive observers to
                      a historical period, which in reality consisted of a
                      violent, radical redrawing of territory by and for
                      European powers.

                      Colonial-era maps served multiple purposes beyond simply
                      indicating boundaries. This map includes text with British
                      political commentary, noting French “Incroachment” and
                      emphasizing the need for British colonial officials to
                      monitor land claims along the Mississippi River. Ten inset
                      diagrams of major ports, including Boston alongside
                      Caribbean, Latin American, and other North American
                      harbors, depict active sites of slave labor. Imperial
                      jostling over land and labor connected colonial Boston to
                      the wider world. Notice the glimpse of Ireland and Great
                      Britain in the map’s top right corner. This small detail
                      illustrates the vast reach of the British Empire and
                      serves as a reminder of how political changes rippling
                      across the Atlantic could affect territories thousands of
                      miles apart.

                      Englanders cultivated few valuable natural resources of
                      their own, but they mastered the merchant economy and
                      established Boston as a central shipping and exchange hub.
                      The city became what geographers call an
                      <em>entrepôt</em>—a place where goods are imported,
                      traded, repackaged, and exported again.

                      Published on the eve of the Seven Years’ War, Thomas
                      Jefferys’s map includes detailed annotations highlighting
                      territorial disputes, particularly around the Mississippi
                      River and Nova Scotia. After the war, when France was
                      expelled from North America, Boston’s position within the
                      Atlantic trade network grew more complicated as Britain
                      imposed new taxes and deployed troops to secure its
                      hard-won territories.

                  <strong>Boston served as Britain’s regional administrative center,
                    managing tensions between Indigenous nations, frontier
                    outposts, and other colonists as imperial control expanded
                    to Canada and the Appalachians.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early days of colonial settlement, New Englanders
                  oriented themselves along the coast towards the rich fisheries
                  of the Gulf of Maine. By the eighteenth century, they
                  gradually pushed inland into the forests and hills stretching
                  from Massachusetts towards the St. Lawrence River and Great
                  Lakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  British officials in Boston faced numerous conflicts while
                  managing this corner of the empire, notably between the
                  Mi’kmaq peoples, British outposts, and French settlers in
                  Acadia, the region which today stretches from Maine into Nova
                  Scotia and maritime Canada. Soldiers and sailors from New
                  England were heavily involved in these imperial campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  War was a costly enterprise, and the British Parliament soon
                  imposed the Sugar Act (1764) and Stamp Act (1765) on the North
                  American colonies to fund frontier troops and pay off debt.
                  Many Bostonians vehemently opposed these taxes, angry over
                  their lack of political representation in London, and
                  bristling at the government’s increased supervision of the New
                  England economy.

                    Boston’s geography made it different from other colonial
                    cities. Because Boston was surrounded by water and highly
                    dependent on maritime trade, new tax policies
                    disproportionately impacted Bostonians.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1772, the people of Boston and Salem alone paid 34% of
                    all the Sugar Act tax revenue collected from the 13
                    colonies. Paying ⅓ of the colonial tax load, Bostonians felt
                    unfairly targeted by policies that threatened their
                    livelihoods and everyday lives.

                      Because European colonists could travel more swiftly by
                      ship along the coastline than they could along rudimentary
                      backcountry roads, water united the regional geography of
                      eighteenth-century New England. Radiating nautical lines
                      and detailed coastlines show the vital maritime
                      connections between Boston, New England, and Acadia. In
                      the eighteenth century, Boston had a powerful
                      administrative reach over these territories.

                      Southack’s map focuses on harbors, bays, and seas, showing
                      how ocean networks facilitated Britain’s growing ambitions
                      in Nova Scotia. Boston is given special attention in an
                      inset.

                    <p>
                      Southack’s cartographic choices reflect his unique
                      position as commander of Massachusetts Bay’s
                      <em>Province Galley</em>, a vessel that served as a kind
                      of early naval force in New England waters. From the 1690s
                      through the early 1700s, Southack spent nearly two decades
                      patrolling these coasts, protecting colonial shipping and
                      advancing imperial interests during Queen Anne’s War
                      (1702–1713). The combination of the regional view and
                      detailed Boston inset shows how the colony’s capital
                      served as a base for projecting power northward during
                      this crucial period of imperial expansion.

                      This map illustrates Boston’s position within the Atlantic
                      world, highlighting the strategic importance of Nova
                      Scotia and the Gulf of Maine, as well as the overlapping
                      claims of Indigenous peoples and French and British
                      forces. In the middle of the eighteenth century, imperial
                      officials in Boston managed an increasingly unstable
                      geography where longstanding relations between Indigenous
                      nations, the Acadians, and English settlers gave way to
                      growing imperial ambitions. The map labels the “Abnakies”
                      (Abenaki) in Maine and the “Micmacs” (Mi’kmaq) in Nova
                      Scotia. It also provides special detail in an inset
                      showing the stronghold town of Louisbourg on Cape Breton
                      Island, which occupied a strategic location at the mouth
                      of the St. Lawrence River. New Englanders led a siege of
                      Louisbourg in 1745, a prelude to the conflict that erupted
                      into the Seven Year’s War in 1756. During the 1750s and
                      1760s, more than 11,000 French-speaking Acadians were
                      expelled from their homes under threat of violence from
                      the British, further destabilizing the region.

                        peoples’ lands illustrates British territorial
                        aspirations, which clashed with the reality of
                        indigenous sovereignty.

                      When we imagine New England’s geography today, we likely
                      think about its location relative to the rest of the
                      United States. But in the eighteenth century, Boston was
                      at the center of a distinct regional economy formed by
                      Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
                      Hampshire, and the city was often referred to as “the
                      Metropolis of New England.” This French map, created by
                      Georges-Louis Le Rouge, juxtaposes two scales: a sweeping
                      view of New England’s contested territories alongside an
                      intimate glimpse of Boston.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Though the map claims to portray the “most inhabited part”
                      of the region, this designation referred only to areas
                      inhabited by colonists, not to the ancestral homelands of
                      the thousands of Indigenous peoples displaced by European
                      colonizers. A large interior frontier, marked by spaces
                      not yet divided into towns, ran through Massachusetts, New
                      Hampshire, and the disputed territory of what is now
                      Vermont.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The environmental conditions of upland New England were
                      poorly suited for the large-scale plantation agricultural
                      practices of the eighteenth century, which meant colonists
                      were dependent on coastal trade for economic growth. As
                      the British government began to consolidate control over
                      its international trade networks, New England, and Boston
                      in particular, stood in a particularly vulnerable
                      position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Le Rouge brought a unique perspective to the map you see
                      here. Born in Germany, he later trained as a military
                      engineer before relocating to Paris, where he built a
                      career translating and adapting English maps for French
                      audiences. This map reflects his careful attention to both
                      regional and local detail. In the inset at the upper left,
                      Boston is presented as a complex urban space, rather than
                      a dot on a regional map. Placed together, these local and
                      regional scales help us understand how Boston’s local
                      geography shaped imperial ambitions across a contested New
                      England. Compare the Boston inset to the regional map of
                      New England. Notice how details that are visible at city
                      scale disappear at the regional scale.

                      This 1775 map illustrates an important shift in colonial
                      American cartography. Placing Boston at the center of a
                      30-mile radius that encompasses towns in Essex, Middlesex,
                      and Suffolk counties, it emphasizes the city as a local
                      hub, rather than a distant outpost of the British Empire.
                    </p>

                      While we might now view Boston and its surrounding suburbs
                      as part of one metropolis, in the eighteenth century
                      Boston and the rural towns around it actually operated in
                      different spheres. Most rural New Englanders felt
                      disconnected from the grievances voiced by merchants in
                      the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The separateness of these spheres shifted when British
                      administrators began undermining Boston’s autonomy and
                      local governance. While farmers in places like Concord may
                      have been ambivalent about the taxation of trade goods,
                      they <em>did</em> bristle at threats to self-government
                      that they had known for over a century. The resulting
                      alliance of urban Bostonians and rural New Englanders
                      proved crucial—it united the material and political
                      resources needed to convert scattered discontent into an
                      outright rebellion against imperial control.

                      This map shows us a colonial city built for trade but
                      transformed by conflict—from the wharves where merchants
                      protested British taxes, to the narrow neck where British
                      troops built fortifications, to the surrounding hills
                      where American forces eventually positioned their guns.
                      Boston was practically an island, with only the neck
                      connecting it to the mainland. This geography meant the
                      British could easily control the city—or get trapped
                      inside of it. Richard Williams’s map helps us understand
                      why the British military forces found themselves
                      increasingly isolated as revolutionary sentiment flared
                      throughout New England.

                    British port to a center of political unrest, where
                    residents navigated a growing conflict between liberty and
                    freedom.</strong>

                  Soldiers, civilians, free and enslaved workers, migrants, and
                  many others jostled together in an urban area of just a few
                  square miles. The city’s shape—a peninsula connected to the
                  mainland by a tombolo, or narrow spit of land—created a
                  terrain for both resistance and military strategy that pivoted
                  on key points and routes. This landscape shaped the early
                  events of Revolutionary crisis, from the Boston Massacre in
                  1770 to the Tea Party in 1773 to the early months of fighting
                  in 1775.

                  Boston stood out among colonial cities for its resistance to
                  British authority and widespread support for independence. But
                  allegiances during the Revolution rarely fit neatly into one
                  group. Colonists across social classes weighed competing
                  loyalties to family, religion, and occupation, making
                  difficult choices that often changed as the war raged on. Some
                  tried to remain neutral. Others maintained their ties to
                  Britain, preferring British rule to the uncertainties of a new
                  American government. These “Tories,” as rebel Bostonians
                  mockingly called them, came from varied backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, Black Bostonians—both free and enslaved—challenged
                  the hypocrisy of slaveholding rebels by pursuing freedom and
                  autonomy through petitions, fugitive self-emancipation, and
                  military service. Maps reveal the city’s connections and
                  vulnerabilities, showing how Boston’s local resistance rippled
                  outward to ignite a continental war.

                    In 1765, 15,520 people lived in Boston. The composition of
                    the population shifted in October 1768 with the arrival of
                    British troops. Suddenly, 1 in 3 men living in Boston were
                    British soldiers.

                      Here we see Boston when it was still a British
                      administrative hub. Only a few North American cities were
                      mapped on this scale and at this level of detail before
                      the Revolution. The carefully labeled streets, wharves,
                      and public buildings reveal a prosperous port city where
                      different social classes lived near each other, with
                      churches, meeting houses, and schools densely dotted
                      throughout the urban core. Yet the very features that made
                      Boston valuable to Britain—its deep harbor, network of
                      wharves, and location in the New England region—would soon
                      help transform it into a center of resistance. In these
                      crowded neighborhoods, news of protests and riots spread
                      quickly, allowing people of all ranks to see British
                      presence and enforcement as a shared threat.

                      This map tells us a lot about the outbreak of violence
                      that shaped life across New England in 1775. It includes
                      several key battles and troop movements in Massachusetts,
                      including Lexington and Concord in April, Bunker Hill and
                      Charlestown in June, and General George Washington’s
                      arrival to command the colonial forces around Boston in
                      July. During this three-month period, word of military
                      clashes between rebels and British troops spread. This
                      map, printed in London, helped inform the public about the
                      war unfolding in the distant American colonies. It quickly
                      became a crucial source of geographic information about
                      the war; even Washington himself kept a copy in his
                      personal collection.

                      Behind the notes of troop movements and battles on this
                      map lie the individual stories of people who found
                      themselves entangled in war. About 20,000 militiamen
                      ventured to Massachusetts to support the Continental Army.
                      While George Washington is named, most soldiers
                      represented are anonymous. Their ranks included not only
                      white colonists, but also Black and Indigenous men who
                      joined the revolutionary cause despite being denied basic
                      rights and citizenship—the very freedoms they helped
                      secure for others through enlistment.

                    <p>
                      Luther Jotham (c. 1751–1832), a free Black man, joined the
                      Bridgewater Minute Men and fought at Lexington and
                      Concord. His service offered steady pay, a pension, and a
                      chance at social equality. He served in the Continental
                      Army under Colonel Cary during the British evacuation of
                      Dorchester Heights, and enlisted for four terms, ending in
                      October 1777.

                    <p>
                      Jude Hall (c. 1760–1827), a formerly enslaved man from New
                      Hampshire, joined the Third New Hampshire Regiment and
                      fought at Bunker Hill. Hall was reportedly thrown off his
                      feet by a cannonball blast but survived to fight at
                      Ticonderoga, Trenton, and Saratoga. Despite eight years of
                      service, Hall’s life was marred by the Revolution’s
                      unfulfilled promise of liberty. His sons, though born
                      free, were later kidnapped and sold into slavery in
                      Louisiana and the West Indies. He never saw them again.

                    <h3>Bunker’s Hill</h3>
                    <p>
                      At Bunker Hill, at least 15 Indigenous soldiers fought for
                      the Continental Army, representing the Mashpee Wampanoag,
                      Hassanamisco Nipmuc, Tunxis, Mohegan, and Pequot tribes.
                      Eight served in Captain John Durkee’s integrated company.
                      Their reasons for enlisting were complex. Some shared
                      white colonists’ frustrations with British taxation;
                      others saw military service as a way to maintain local
                      alliances with their white neighbors. The
                      Stockbridge-Munsee Mohicans were the first Indigenous
                      group to enlist, possibly influenced by their conversion
                      to Protestantism.

                      While no Black Loyalists fought for the British at Bunker
                      Hill, an estimated 80,000-100,000 enslaved people escaped
                      to British protection following Lord Dunmore’s 1775
                      proclamation offering freedom to those who joined the
                      British side. The “Book of Negroes,” from the 1783 British
                      evacuation of New York, records 18 people from
                      Massachusetts, including the Slade family—Freelove, her
                      husband Lot, and their son Roger—who escaped in 1779. They
                      helped establish Birchtown, Nova Scotia, and later a free
                      Black community in Sierra Leone.

                      George Washington, Commander in Chief of the Continental
                      Army, initially opposed Black and Indigenous enlistment.
                      When the British offered freedom to enslaved people who
                      joined their ranks, he changed his mind. By 1776, he
                      allowed already-serving free Black soldiers to remain.
                      Between 5,000 to 8,000 Black soldiers served with the
                      Continental Army.

                      In Massachusetts, enslaved people fought for their freedom
                      through legal means, often appealing to principles that
                      derived from New England’s experiments with democratic
                      government. Black women often led this charge. In 1773, a
                      group of enslaved residents petitioned the Massachusetts
                      General Court, questioning how colonists could demand
                      liberty while denying it to others. Elizabeth Freeman (c.
                      1744–1829), born “Mum Bett,” used the new state
                      constitution, which declared “all men are born free and
                      equal,” to successfully challenge slavery in court in
                      1781. Her victory set a powerful precedent, and
                      Massachusetts later became first state to effectively
                      abolish slavery in 1783.

                  <strong>The places where Bostonians lived, gathered, worked, and
                    clashed became crucial sites of Revolutionary
                    ferment.</strong>

                  The American Revolution wasn’t just fought on the battlefield.
                  It played out in civic landmarks and the intimate spaces of
                  daily life. Zooming in to the smallest scale allows us to
                  think about how an abstract clash of values and ideals
                  materialized in people’s individual worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Public gathering places, like the Liberty Tree, offered
                  Bostonians a place to protest, while the Boston Common offered
                  soldiers a place to prepare and civilians to celebrate. Forts,
                  including Castle William, sheltered members of the British
                  military and eventually became key locations in the
                  Continental Army’s efforts to expel the British during the
                  war. Private homes were sites of resistance as women
                  spearheaded boycotts and championed a movement to produce
                  homespun goods. Merchant offices became a nexus of commerce,
                  politics, labor, and slavery. In the spaces of everyday life,
                  people of different races, ages, genders, classes, and
                  backgrounds experienced the Revolution in different ways.

                  Merchants Row was a site of trade, slavery, and political
                  unrest in eighteenth-century Boston. The warehouses along this
                  street, including those owned by Peter Faneuil, slave trader
                  and namesake of Faneuil Hall, stood as physical reminders of
                  the links between commerce and slavery. During the colonial
                  period this was a key site of the slave trade, where humans
                  were bought and sold. During the Revolution, some of the same
                  buildings became landmarks of resistance, where merchants like
                  John Hancock organized against political oppression. The
                  geographic overlap echoes America’s foundational paradox: a
                  revolutionary fight for liberty conducted amid the continued
                  practice of human bondage.

                  In the 1760s, Boston’s streets weren’t just pathways; they
                  were landmarks of public protest. This broadside captured Pope
                  Night celebrations as they morphed from traditional
                  anti-Catholic observances into political protest during and
                  after the Stamp Act crisis. The typical effigies of the Pope
                  and Devil were joined by caricatures of unpopular British
                  officials. References to rival North and South End
                  neighborhoods, wagons, and celebrating crowds illustrate how
                  colonial grievances found expression through public
                  celebration.

                  Paul Revere’s 1766 engraving depicts a four-sided obelisk, or
                  monument, erected near Boston Common to celebrate Parliament’s
                  repeal of the Stamp Act. The obelisk, which stood for just a
                  short time, features imagery honoring British leaders and
                  proclaiming loyalty to King George III, while celebrating the
                  colonists’ restored rights and liberties. Physical monuments
                  like this obelisk served as public message boards in an era
                  before electronic communication. They provided spaces where
                  colonists gathered to develop their shared identity and
                  political awareness.

                  Even the natural landscape could serve as a landmark. Liberty
                  Trees were used by both Patriots and Loyalists as powerful
                  symbols of colonial resistance, either to mobilize or mock.
                  One tree grew at the intersection of Washington and Essex
                  Streets in downtown Boston. Today it is marked by a colorful
                  plaque. This print, produced following the Boston Tea Party
                  and the closing of the Boston Harbor under the Coercive Acts,
                  was circulated widely in British newspapers. It pokes fun at
                  Bostonians’ claims for liberty, depicting them imprisoned in a
                  cage suspended from a Liberty Tree. Three British sailors feed
                  the prisoners fish in exchange for a packet of papers.

                  Boston’s Quaker Lane, once notable for its meeting house,
                  became a landmark of peaceful resistance during the
                  Revolution. Upholding their commitment to non-violence,
                  Quakers joined ordinary men and women outside the political
                  elite in turning to boycotts and non-importation to express
                  discontent with British rule. As leaders of the Homespun
                  movement, Quakers encouraged colonists to make their own
                  clothing instead of buying British goods. The movement
                  included many women who organized community spinning bees and
                  managed their families’ purchases of textiles and clothing.

                  Revolutionary landmarks were referenced in all forms of
                  popular culture, including widely published broadsides. This
                  poem commemorates the Boston Tea Party of December 16, 1773,
                  when colonists, disguised as Indigenous people, ventured to
                  Griffin’s Wharf and dumped 342 chests of British tea into the
                  harbor to protest taxation policies. The title’s reference to
                  “TEA, DESTROYED BY INDIANS" both acknowledges the
                  colonists’ disguise and celebrates their act of rebellion.
                  Using powerful maritime imagery with the ship woodcut at the
                  top, the poem frames the Tea Party as a gallant stand for
                  liberty, capturing a moment when Boston’s resistance to
                  British rule was openly celebrated.

                  During the siege of Boston from 1775 to 1776, British forces
                  blockaded the Neck, the narrow strip of land that connected
                  the city to the mainland. These fortifications protected
                  British troops from colonial forces, while punishing New
                  Englanders by cutting off the only land route into Boston.
                  This widely printed image made Boston Neck a recognizable
                  landmark for colonists elsewhere, introducing readers to
                  detailed intelligence about British military defenses in
                  Boston.

                  Boston’s Revolutionary landmarks span geography and
                  generations. In this photo, an unnamed Black man stands beside
                  the Prince Hall Monument in Copp’s Hill Burying Ground, an
                  1895 memorial marking the burial site of Prince Hall. Hall was
                  a freed Black man whose life intersected with key
                  Revolutionary sites across Boston Harbor. At Castle William, a
                  strategic British fortification shown in the plan
                  <a href="#page-castle-william">on the next page</a>, Hall and
                  fourteen other free Black men made history in 1775 when they
                  were initiated into Freemasonry through a British military
                  lodge. While the British would later burn Castle William
                  during their retreat from Boston in March 1776, Hall’s legacy
                  endured through his activism and leadership. Today, his
                  gravesite has become a landmark and destination for Freemasons
                  and civil rights advocates from around the world. It stands in
                  stark contrast to the thousands of unmarked graves of Black
                  Bostonians from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries
                  buried nearby.

                  Each of these physical objects has a geographic story to tell,
                  representing the five scales of this exhibition. People living
                  in eighteenth and early nineteenth century Boston would have
                  been familiar with objects like these, some of which traveled
                  thousands of miles to arrive in the city, while others were
                  created nearby.

                <p>
                  For much of the eighteenth century, colonists expressed their
                  cultural identity as citizens of the British Empire through
                  objects and rituals associated with tea. Tea drinking’s
                  popularity led to a surge in production of teapots, cups,
                  saucers, and spoons. This spoon, excavated from Faneuil Hall,
                  may have stirred tea sweetened with sugar produced by enslaved
                  labor in the Caribbean, reflecting Boston’s ties to a wider
                  empire built on slavery. During the Revolution, tea took on a
                  new meaning as a symbol of resistance, as colonists threw
                  chests of tea overboard in protest, and women boycotted tea in
                  favor of drinking chocolate.

                    Institute for Conservation Archaeology at the Maudlin

                  Many ships made voyages along the coast of the New England
                  region in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ballast
                  consisted of heavy materials such as rocks placed in a ship’s
                  hold to maintain stability and proper buoyancy during sailing.
                  This ballast came from the James Garrett House Site in
                  Charlestown, which was excavated before Boston’s Big Dig
                  construction project. Garrett, a wealthy English merchant,
                  lived there between 1639 and 1656. Archaeologists also found
                  stone tool <em>debitage</em> (debris from stone tool making)
                  showing that Indigenous people used the area before and
                  possibly during the time period of Garrett family’s residency.

                  This powder horn, signed “E.B.,” belonged to a British soldier
                  occupying Boston from 1775 to 1776. Used for storing
                  gunpowder, with removable plugs at both ends for filling and
                  pouring, the horn features a map of Boston and Charlestown.
                  It’s likely that E.B. decorated this horn himself, carving a
                  crown to symbolize his loyalty to the king, and a British
                  man-of-war ship. He also inscribed his contempt for the
                  Patriots: “A Pox on rebels in their crymes [crimes].”

                  This musket ball and gunflint, excavated from the Boston
                  Common, were likely left behind by British soldiers stationed
                  there in 1775. These items may have been dropped during
                  routine drills or daily activities as the British Army tried
                  to subdue the colonial rebellion. These ordinary objects,
                  among countless artillery tools used by both sides, offer a
                  small-scale glimpse into the remnants of the British Army’s
                  ten-month siege of Boston.

                  In the eighteenth century, the Boston Common was the location
                  of a powder house, a structure used for storing gunpowder.
                  This landmark was so recognizable that it frequently appeared
                  in period maps and engravings. Because these explosive
                  storehouses posed risks to nearby people and buildings, they
                  were typically built in isolated areas. Boston’s cow pasture,
                  better known as the Common, proved an ideal setting. This
                  brick is a remnant of that powder house, which the British
                  Army demolished to prevent rebel access to munitions.

                  Boston sought to reinvent itself in the new republic by
                  building grand civic spaces befitting the state of
                  Massachusetts. This small <em>sherd</em> (pottery fragment) of
                  blue transfer-printed pearlware depicts a portion of the State
                  House roof. The Charles Bulfinch-designed building was
                  constructed in 1795 and replaced the Old State House on State
                  Street as the site of government. The iconic golden dome we
                  know today was not present until 1874, when the original
                  wooden and copper dome was gilded.

                  <strong>The Revolutionary War created a new nation, with new maps
                    that placed Boston on the eastern edge of a sovereign
                    republic.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the British evacuated from Boston in March 1776, the war
                  shifted to other regions. The mid-Atlantic and South became
                  critical battlegrounds, with their strategic ports and
                  abundant land—much of which was the political domain of
                  Indigenous nations. Across eastern North America, Continental
                  and British forces sought control over resources, territory,
                  and trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The British defeat at Yorktown, Virginia in 1781 marked the
                  last major military engagement of the Revolution. Although the
                  thirteen colonies had declared independence in 1776,
                  Yorktown’s outcome strengthened their position and set the
                  stage for final negotiations. The Treaty of Paris in 1783
                  ended the war, securing independence for a new nation—one that
                  didn’t yet have an agreed-upon name or territorial identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By this point, Boston’s role had shifted from a strategic
                  center of military resistance to a powerful national symbol.
                  The city that Britain had once viewed as a distant colonial
                  port was now part of an expanding continental republic.
                  Regions that had once been important to Boston, like Acadia,
                  were now separated by an international border. New political
                  lines, economic networks, and social geographies would
                  redefine the city’s place in the United States—and the
                  nation’s role in the world.

                      This map captures Massachusetts defining its place in the
                      new political landscape. The map itself was created
                      through a process that symbolized the values of political
                      localism and federalism. In 1794, the Massachusetts
                      legislature ordered its towns to conduct surveys which
                      would be sent to the capital in Boston, reflecting the
                      nation’s commitment to self-governance and documentation.
                      Now designated a Commonwealth in its new State
                      Constitution—signifying a political body formed by the
                      people—Massachusetts understood that an official map would
                      showcase not just its political boundaries, but its
                      physical and economic character as well. Americans eagerly
                      consumed other geographic publications too, from almanacs
                      and botanical surveys to navigational guides and
                      gazetteers. Massachusetts had transformed from a colony
                      into a sovereign state within the nation, fundamentally
                      changing both its geographic identity and its global
                      relationships.

                      Following the Treaty of Paris, American territorial
                      ambitions bumped up against the realities of North
                      American geography. In this map, sharply defined state
                      boundaries along the Atlantic coast gradually dissolve
                      into more speculative geography in the west, where
                      Indigenous lands and contested frontiers created uncertain
                      borders. The map emphasizes natural boundaries—the Great
                      Lakes, the Mississippi River, and the Gulf of Mexico—that
                      would shape American expansion in the decades ahead. Maps
                      like this one reveal both the limits and aspirations of
                      the geographical knowledge and territorial reach of a new
                      nation, one which was still referred to here as the
                      “United States of North America.”

                      Revised from a British map, this map by French
                      cartographer Pierre Tardieu presented a view of America
                      shaped by France’s alliance during the Revolution. The
                      inclusion of French-born architect Pierre Charles
                      L’Enfant’s plan for the nation’s capital in Washington,
                      D.C. symbolized how Americans embraced French cultural and
                      political influence rather than British colonial precedent
                      in the early national period. Even the depiction of
                      Niagara Falls in the cartouche suggests a reorientation
                      toward North America’s distinct natural landmarks and the
                      geographic wonders of the interior. Boston, which had once
                      lay on the western edge of the Atlantic empire and at the
                      center of a lucrative maritime trading network, now stood
                      in an uncertain position at the northeastern corner of an
                      expanding American republic.

                      While claiming to present the “whole continent,” this map
                      actually shows us how much remained unknown or contested
                      about American geography after the Revolution. The inset
                      map of the northern territories suggests that the primary
                      map alone couldn’t adequately capture all of North
                      America’s geography, especially in the regions where
                      British interests persisted after American independence.
                      The map’s hemispheric perspective, stretching from the
                      Arctic to Cape Horn, places the United States within a
                      broader continental context of ongoing European colonial
                      projects and territorial claims. The new nation and other
                      imperial powers continued to compete over land claims in
                      this vast space. Although European publishers like Robert
                      Sayer had to update their maps in the 1780s to reflect the
                      territorial sovereignty of the United States, the new
                      nation was only one part of the evolving geography of the
                      Americas. Just a few years after this map was published,
                      the Haitian Revolution, led by enslaved people in the
                      French colony of Saint-Domingue, would create the second
                      postcolonial independent state in the Americas.

                        This map shows an outline of the Americas that is so
                        familiar it might almost seem boring.

                      <p>
                        Imagine seeing these geographic outlines for the first
                        time: How would you describe this “new” place? Where
                        would you place yourself as a new citizen of the United
                        States? How would you view these boundaries if they had
                        been imposed on you? What if you viewed this map from
                        the “other” side of the world?
